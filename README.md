# Parametric Padlock
A little idea for a parametric padlock svg.

## `withSettings`
Project also include a `withSettings` higher order component that is a re-usable "demo harness" for components.  It takes configuration defining the controls that should be generated to drive the props of the wrapped component.

## Running the project
The project was created with create-react-app.  Assuming you have node and yarn installed, in the project root run:
- `yarn install`
- `yarn start`
A browser will open with the running application.
